# slice-library-starter-next

The quickest way to build a Slice Library for [Slice Machine](https://www.slicemachine.dev/) websites using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

**What is a Slice Library?**<br/>
It's a sharable collection of reusable website sections. They can be used in sites built with [Prismic][prismic].

## üëâ&nbsp; Getting started

Start a new Slice Library project using this starter with the following commands:

```bash
# Replace your-library-name with your Slice Library's name
#   (example: "slice-library-tailwind-ui")
npx degit@latest \
  prismicio-community/slice-library-starter-next \
  your-library-name

# Navigate into your Slice Library project
cd your-library-name

# Install the project's dependencies
npm install

# Start Slice Machine and the Next.js dev server
npm run dev
```

After starting Slice Machine, open [http://localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999) with your browser to view Slice Machine.

Now you can begin creating Slices for your Slice Library. The process of making a Slice in a Slice Library is the same as making one for a full website.

## üéÅ&nbsp; Sharing your Slice Library

You can share your Slice Library with others by pushing it to GitHub in a public repository.

Users can then install your Slices into their existing or new project with the following command:

```bash
npx @slicemachine/init@latest \
  --lib your-username/your-library-name
```

To help users install your Slices, be sure to write a README with installation instructions. If your library requires special setup, such as installing a specific library or configuring a file, include those steps.

An example README is included at `./README-example.md` that can be used as a starting point for your own README.
