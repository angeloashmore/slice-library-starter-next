This is a [Prismic](https://prismic.io) Slice Library for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

You can create a Slice Library with the following steps:

1. Use Slice Machine to model your Slices and create their React components.
2. Push the project to GitHub.
3. Deploy the Next.js app and update the `sliceCanvasURL` entry in `slicelibrary.json`.

When you are ready to share the library with others, submit it the Slice Library Showcase.

## üëâ Getting started

Start a new Slice Library project using this starter.

```bash
# Replace your-library-name with your Slice Library's name
#   (example: "slice-library-tailwind-ui")
npx degit@latest prismicio-community/slice-library-starter-next your-library-name

# Navigate into your Slice Library project
cd your-library-name

# Install the project's dependencies
npm install

# Start Slice Machine and the Next.js dev server
npm run dev
```

After starting Slice Machine, open [http://localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999) with your browser to view Slice Machine.

Now you can begin creating Slices for your Slice Library. The process of making a Slice in a Slice Library is the same as making one for a full website.

## üéÅ Sharing your Slice Library

You can share your Slice Library with others by pushing it to GitHub in a public repository.

Users can then install your Slices into their existing or new project with the following command:

```bash
npx @slicemachine/init@latest --lib your-username/your-library-name
```

To help users install your Slices, be sure to write a README with installation instructions. If your library requires special setup, such as installing a specific library or configuring a file, include those steps.

An example README is included at `./README-example.md` that can be used as a starting point for your own README.
